Sharpe Ratio Normalization Explanation!!!!
This is a copy of a chat between Claude and Shir. Shared snapshot may contain attachments and data not displayed here which may have altered Claude’s responses.

Report
S
I uploded my main.py and a result csv to the project knowledge. 
In this project, i try to predict daily sharpe ratio for stocks. 
i need you to look at the code - how the sharpe is calculated, and on the results (the column-Best_Prediction, is the predicted sharpe) and help me figure put if i need to normalize the results to -1:1, and if notmalization wont harm the results in this case. The reason for me to normalize this is because when ill get input from the user (lets say- trader) the input will be a risk threshold for the program to tolerate. the risk suppose to be a precantage so also the sharpe.

I've analyzed your code and the results to help you decide whether to normalize the Sharpe ratios. Let me break this down for you:

How Sharpe Ratio is Calculated in Your Code
In your code, the Sharpe ratio is calculated in the TransactionMetricsCalculator class:

python

Copy
# For each transaction (buy to sell period):
returns = (data['Close'].iloc[i] - last_buy_price) / last_buy_price
daily_returns = data['Close'].iloc[last_buy_index:i+1].pct_change().dropna()
volatility = daily_returns.std()
transaction_risk_free_rate = self.risk_free_rate * (duration / 365)
sharpe_ratio = (returns - transaction_risk_free_rate) / volatility if volatility != 0 else 0
This is a standard Sharpe ratio calculation where:

Returns are calculated as percentage changes
Volatility is the standard deviation of daily returns
The risk-free rate is adjusted for the duration of the transaction
Analysis of Your Results
Looking at your results CSV, I notice:

Sharpe ratio values are not constrained to any specific range
Both actual and predicted Sharpe ratios can have large positive or negative values
Should You Normalize to [-1, 1]?
Considerations:
Traditional Sharpe Ratio Context:
Sharpe ratios typically don't have a fixed range
Values above 1 are generally considered good
Values above 2 are very good
Values above 3 are excellent
Negative values indicate underperformance compared to the risk-free rate
User Interface Considerations:
If you want traders to input a risk threshold that corresponds directly to the Sharpe ratio, having normalized values might make this more intuitive
However, normalizing would lose the standard meaning/interpretation of Sharpe ratios that traders may be familiar with
Technical Implications:
Normalization won't harm your model's predictive capability if done consistently
However, you would need to denormalize the results to interpret them in the traditional Sharpe ratio context
Recommendations
Given your specific use case (having traders input risk thresholds):

Maintain both versions:
Keep the original Sharpe ratios for model evaluation and financial analysis
Create normalized versions in the [-1, 1] range for user input mapping
Implementation approach:
python

Copy
# Find min and max values in your training data
min_sharpe = min(data_clean['Transaction_Sharpe'])
max_sharpe = max(data_clean['Transaction_Sharpe'])

# Normalize function
def normalize_sharpe(sharpe):
    return 2 * ((sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe)) - 1
    
# Denormalize function
def denormalize_sharpe(norm_sharpe):
    return ((norm_sharpe + 1) / 2) * (max_sharpe - min_sharpe) + min_sharpe
Risk Threshold Mapping:
Have traders input a risk tolerance value between -1 (highest risk tolerance) and 1 (lowest risk tolerance)
Use this normalized value to filter predicted trades:
python

Copy
# Example usage
normalized_predictions = [normalize_sharpe(pred) for pred in best_prediction]
risk_threshold = user_input  # Between -1 and 1

# Filter trades
acceptable_trades = [i for i, pred in enumerate(normalized_predictions) if pred >= risk_threshold]
This approach gives you the best of both worlds - maintaining the financial meaning of the Sharpe ratio for analysis while providing an intuitive interface for user inputs.

Alternatively, you could skip normalization and simply map user risk tolerance inputs (e.g., 1-10 scale) to appropriate Sharpe ratio thresholds based on financial best practices (e.g., 1=0.5, 5=1.5, 10=3.0).

Would you like me to elaborate on either approach or would you prefer a different recommendation?



S
explain the normalize function please
# Find min and max values in your training data
min_sharpe = min(data_clean['Transaction_Sharpe'])
max_sharpe = max(data_clean['Transaction_Sharpe'])
# Normalize function
def normalize_sharpe(sharpe):
    return 2 * ((sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe)) - 1

# Denormalize function
def denormalize_sharpe(norm_sharpe):
    return ((norm_sharpe + 1) / 2) * (max_sharpe - min_sharpe) + min_sharpe

I'd be happy to explain the normalization function in detail:

Normalization Function Explanation
python

Copy
def normalize_sharpe(sharpe):
    return 2 * ((sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe)) - 1
This function performs what's known as min-max normalization with a specific output range of [-1, 1]. Let me break down how it works step-by-step:

Step 1: (sharpe - min_sharpe)
This subtracts the minimum value in your dataset from the current Sharpe ratio. This shifts all values so the minimum value becomes 0.

Step 2: (sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe)
This divides by the range (max - min) of your data. After this step, all your values are now scaled to the range [0, 1], where:

The minimum Sharpe ratio in your dataset maps to 0
The maximum Sharpe ratio in your dataset maps to 1
All other values are proportionally distributed between 0 and 1
Step 3: 2 * ((sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe))
This multiplies the [0, 1] range by 2, giving a range of [0, 2]

Step 4: 2 * ((sharpe - min_sharpe) / (max_sharpe - min_sharpe)) - 1
This subtracts 1, shifting the range from [0, 2] to [-1, 1]

Visualization:
Original Sharpe ratio = min_sharpe → normalized value = -1
Original Sharpe ratio = max_sharpe → normalized value = 1
Original Sharpe ratio = halfway between min and max → normalized value = 0
The denormalization function does the exact opposite, converting values from the [-1, 1] range back to the original Sharpe ratio scale.

Example:
Let's say your Sharpe ratios in the training data range from -2.5 to +4.0:

min_sharpe = -2.5
max_sharpe = 4.0
For a Sharpe ratio of 1.0:


Copy
normalize_sharpe(1.0) = 2 * ((1.0 - (-2.5)) / (4.0 - (-2.5))) - 1
                       = 2 * (3.5 / 6.5) - 1
                       = 2 * 0.538 - 1
                       = 1.076 - 1
                       = 0.076
So a Sharpe ratio of 1.0 would normalize to approximately 0.076 on the [-1, 1] scale.

This normalization allows users to provide risk thresholds in a consistent, bounded range regardless of the specific min/max values in your training data, which might vary across different stocks or time periods.



S
I didnt decide yet what the input from the user (trader) will be. 
The project idea is that the trader input will be risk level OR sharpe ratio that he consider taking in the trades. 
So, basically, i predict dauly sharpe ratio 
but then i get input from the user that indicates the risk level (lets say in precantage risk level) 
what do i do with it? how do i interprate the risk rate of the user to use the sharpe ratio? 
the user will also give the system amount of money to invest

take into account both short and long trades

Based on your project description, you're building a system that predicts daily Sharpe ratios for stocks and then uses trader inputs about risk tolerance to make investment decisions. Let me outline how you can interpret and use the user's risk level with your Sharpe ratio predictions.

Connecting User Risk Input with Sharpe Ratios
Option 1: Direct Sharpe Ratio Threshold
Have the trader input their minimum acceptable Sharpe ratio directly:

python

Copy
# User inputs
min_acceptable_sharpe = float(input("Enter your minimum acceptable Sharpe ratio (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0): "))
investment_amount = float(input("Enter amount to invest: "))
Then filter potential trades:

python

Copy
acceptable_trades = data[data['Best_Prediction'] >= min_acceptable_sharpe]
Option 2: Risk Level to Sharpe Mapping
If you prefer the user to input a risk level (percentage), you can map it to Sharpe thresholds:

python

Copy
# User inputs
risk_tolerance_pct = float(input("Enter your risk tolerance (1-100%): "))
investment_amount = float(input("Enter amount to invest: "))

# Map risk tolerance percentage to Sharpe ratio threshold (inverse relationship)
# Higher risk tolerance = lower required Sharpe ratio
if risk_tolerance_pct >= 80:  # Very aggressive
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 0.2
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 60:  # Aggressive
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 0.5
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 40:  # Moderate
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 1.0
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 20:  # Conservative
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 1.5
else:  # Very conservative
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 2.0
Implementing Trading Logic for Both Long and Short Positions
Since you mentioned both long and short trades, you need to interpret the Sharpe ratios in both directions:

python

Copy
def determine_trades(data, min_acceptable_sharpe, investment_amount):
    # Filter for acceptable Sharpe ratios (absolute value for short positions)
    potential_trades = data[abs(data['Best_Prediction']) >= min_acceptable_sharpe]
    
    # Separate long and short positions
    long_positions = potential_trades[potential_trades['Best_Prediction'] > 0]
    short_positions = potential_trades[potential_trades['Best_Prediction'] < 0]
    
    # Allocate capital proportionally to Sharpe ratio strength
    total_sharpe_strength = sum(abs(potential_trades['Best_Prediction']))
    
    trades = []
    for idx, row in potential_trades.iterrows():
        # Determine position type
        position_type = "LONG" if row['Best_Prediction'] > 0 else "SHORT"
        
        # Allocate money based on relative Sharpe strength
        allocation = (abs(row['Best_Prediction']) / total_sharpe_strength) * investment_amount
        
        trades.append({
            'date': row.name,  # Assuming index is the date
            'ticker': ticker_symbol,
            'position': position_type,
            'sharpe': row['Best_Prediction'],
            'allocation': round(allocation, 2),
            'buy_price': row['Close'] if 'Close' in row else None
        })
    
    return trades
Advanced Implementation with Position Sizing
You can also use the predicted Sharpe ratio to determine position size, allocating more capital to trades with higher predicted Sharpe ratios:

python

Copy
def allocate_capital(predictions, investment_amount, min_acceptable_sharpe):
    # Filter by minimum acceptable Sharpe
    valid_predictions = predictions[abs(predictions['Best_Prediction']) >= min_acceptable_sharpe]
    
    if valid_predictions.empty:
        return "No trades meet the minimum Sharpe ratio requirement"
    
    # Calculate position sizes proportional to Sharpe ratios
    # Use absolute values for both long and short positions
    sharpe_values = abs(valid_predictions['Best_Prediction'])
    total_sharpe = sharpe_values.sum()
    
    # Allocate proportionally
    valid_predictions['allocation'] = investment_amount * (sharpe_values / total_sharpe)
    
    # Determine if long or short based on sign
    valid_predictions['position_type'] = valid_predictions['Best_Prediction'].apply(
        lambda x: "LONG" if x > 0 else "SHORT"
    )
    
    return valid_predictions[['position_type', 'allocation', 'Best_Prediction']]
Final Considerations
Risk Management: Consider implementing additional risk management such as stop losses or position size limits (e.g., no more than 10% of total capital in a single position).
Portfolio Diversification: Ensure the system doesn't allocate too much to correlated assets by adding diversification constraints.
Trading Costs: Factor in transaction costs which will reduce the actual Sharpe ratio.
User Experience: You could provide visualizations of the predicted Sharpe ratio distribution to help traders set reasonable thresholds.
Backtesting Results: Show the user historical performance of different Sharpe thresholds to help them make informed decisions.
Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this approach, or provide an alternative method for interpreting risk tolerance inputs?



S
i think ill go with something similar to this strategy:
def determine_trades(data, min_acceptable_sharpe, investment_amount):
    # Filter for acceptable Sharpe ratios (absolute value for short positions)
    potential_trades = data[abs(data['Best_Prediction']) >= min_acceptable_sharpe]

    # Separate long and short positions
    long_positions = potential_trades[potential_trades['Best_Prediction'] > 0]
    short_positions = potential_trades[potential_trades['Best_Prediction'] < 0]

    # Allocate capital proportionally to Sharpe ratio strength
    total_sharpe_strength = sum(abs(potential_trades['Best_Prediction']))

    trades = []
    for idx, row in potential_trades.iterrows():
        # Determine position type
        position_type = "LONG" if row['Best_Prediction'] > 0 else "SHORT"

        # Allocate money based on relative Sharpe strength
        allocation = (abs(row['Best_Prediction']) / total_sharpe_strength) * investment_amount

        trades.append({
            'date': row.name,  # Assuming index is the date
            'ticker': ticker_symbol,
            'position': position_type,
            'sharpe': row['Best_Prediction'],
            'allocation': round(allocation, 2),
            'buy_price': row['Close'] if 'Close' in row else None
        })

    return trades

BUT i need help understanding and developing the next steps in my project. 
I have a csv for each ticker, the file have a daily sharpe ratio that the model predicted. 
now i need to do few more things:
1. figure out how to merge the tickers data, u dont think ill work with so much files.. 
2. lets say i mapped the risk from pct to sharpe ratio
3. and lets say i got the moeny amount and a time window - howmuch time the trader want to invest all the money (in one day, week, month...)
4. if i got all these inputs, i need to figure out some daily algorithen to make trades 
first, calculate every day what are the potential transaction according to the threshold 
then calculate long and shorts 
then, invest in each ticker the right amount of money 
5. when do i sell? 
maybe, sell when the sharpe go under the threshold of the user 
and, also sell if the money can go to a different better ticker that day to maximize the sharpe of the protfolio 
6. i need to take under considaration the selling taks of stocks

I'll help you develop the next steps for your project, particularly focusing on the trading algorithm and portfolio management aspects.

1. Merging Ticker Data
To consolidate all your ticker data files, you can create a single merged DataFrame:

python

Copy
import pandas as pd
import os

def merge_ticker_data(directory_path, date_folder):
    """Merge prediction results from multiple tickers into a single DataFrame."""
    all_tickers_data = []
    
    for file in os.listdir(date_folder):
        if file.endswith('_ensamble_prediction_results.csv'):
            ticker = file.split('_')[0]
            file_path = os.path.join(date_folder, file)
            
            # Read the CSV
            ticker_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
            
            # Add ticker column if not present
            if 'ticker' not in ticker_data.columns:
                ticker_data['ticker'] = ticker
                
            all_tickers_data.append(ticker_data)
    
    # Concatenate all DataFrames
    merged_data = pd.concat(all_tickers_data, ignore_index=False)
    
    # Sort by date
    if 'Date' in merged_data.columns:
        merged_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_data['Date'])
        merged_data.sort_values('Date', inplace=True)
    
    return merged_data
2. Daily Trading Algorithm
Here's a comprehensive algorithm that handles all your requirements:

python

Copy

                            investment_period_days, current_date=None, 
                            current_positions=None, transaction_cost_pct=0.001):
    """
    Daily trading algorithm that decides which positions to enter or exit.
    
    Parameters:

4. Tax Considerations
To account for selling taxes:

python

Copy
def calculate_taxes(all_orders, tax_rate=0.15):
    """
    Calculate taxes on realized gains.
    
    Parameters:
    - all_orders: List of all orders
    - tax_rate: Capital gains tax rate (default: 15%)
    
    Returns:
    - orders_with_taxes: Orders with tax calculations
    - total_tax_liability: Total tax to be paid
    """
    # Group orders by ticker
    orders_by_ticker = {}
    for order in all_orders:
        ticker = order['ticker']
        if ticker not in orders_by_ticker:
            orders_by_ticker[ticker] = []
        orders_by_ticker[ticker].append(order)
    
    orders_with_taxes = []
    total_tax_liability = 0
    
    for ticker, ticker_orders in orders_by_ticker.items():
        # Sort orders by date
        ticker_orders.sort(key=lambda x: x['date'])
        
        # Process each order
        for order in ticker_orders:
            order_with_tax = order.copy()
            
            # Only calculate taxes on sell orders
            if order['action'] in ['SELL', 'COVER']:
                # Find corresponding buy order
                buy_orders = [o for o in ticker_orders if o['action'] in ['BUY', 'SHORT'] and 
                             o['date'] < order['date']]
                
                if buy_orders:
                    # For simplicity, using FIFO (First In, First Out)
                    buy_order = buy_orders[0]
                    
                    # Calculate gain/loss
                    buy_price = buy_order['price'] if buy_order['price'] else 0

                    if buy_price and sell_price:
                        gain = (sell_price - buy_price) * order['amount']
                        
                        # Only tax positive gains
                        if gain > 0:
                            tax = gain * tax_rate

            orders_with_taxes.append(order_with_tax)
    
    return orders_with_taxes, total_tax_liability
5. Usage Example
Here's how you might use these functions in your project:

python

Copy
# 1. Merge all ticker data
merged_data = merge_ticker_data('results', date_folder)

# 2. Map user's risk tolerance to Sharpe ratio threshold
risk_tolerance_pct = 50  # Example user input
investment_amount = 100000  # Example user input
investment_period_days = 30  # Example user input

# Map risk tolerance to Sharpe threshold
if risk_tolerance_pct >= 80:  # Very aggressive
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 0.2
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 60:  # Aggressive
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 0.5
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 40:  # Moderate
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 1.0
elif risk_tolerance_pct >= 20:  # Conservative
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 1.5
else:  # Very conservative
    min_acceptable_sharpe = 2.0

# 3. Run portfolio simulation
all_orders, portfolio_value, final_positions = run_portfolio_simulation(
    merged_data, 
    min_acceptable_sharpe, 
    investment_amount,
    investment_period_days
)

# 4. Calculate taxes
orders_with_taxes, total_tax = calculate_taxes(all_orders)

# 5. Generate performance report
print(f"Total Tax Liability: ${total_tax:.2f}")
print(f"After-Tax Return: {((portfolio_value['total_value'].iloc[-1] - total_tax) / investment_amount - 1) * 100:.2f}%")

# 6. Visualize portfolio performance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(portfolio_value['date'], portfolio_value['total_value'])
plt.title('Portfolio Value Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Portfolio Value ($)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Next Steps
Backtesting: Implement proper backtesting to validate your approach across different market conditions.
Risk Management: Add more sophisticated risk management like stop-loss orders and maximum drawdown constraints.
Diversification Constraints: Ensure the portfolio doesn't become too concentrated in a few positions.
User Interface: Create a simple interface for traders to input their preferences and view results.
Performance Metrics: Add more comprehensive performance metrics like maximum drawdown, Sortino ratio, etc.
Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation or if you need help with additional components!
